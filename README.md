# LSTM Prediction App

This project is a Python-based application that uses an **LSTM deep learning model** for sequence classification.  
It processes sequential input data and predicts one of three possible classes.  

## Features
- Built with **Python** and **TensorFlow/Keras**  
- Handles sequential data (e.g., time-series, sensor readings)  
- Outputs predictions with probability scores  
- Includes helper functions for preprocessing and model inference  
- Can be deployed as a **web app** using Streamlit or Flask  

## Project Files
- `app.py` → Main application file  
- `function.py` → Helper functions for preprocessing and predictions  
- `model.json` → Pre-trained LSTM model structure  

## Setup
- Clone the repository  
- Install required packages:  

  pip install -r requirements.txt
